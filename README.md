The objective of this project is to develop a secure steganographic technique for concealing messages within digital images. The challenge is to create a method that ensures the hidden message can be reliably extracted without causing distortion or data loss in the host image. The technique must be imperceptible to the human eye, meaning that the presence of the hidden message should be visually undetectable. Additionally, the developed steganography should exhibit resistance to various image processing techniques, ensuring the robustness and security of the concealed information. The successful implementation of this steganographic approach will contribute to enhancing the security and confidentiality of digital communication by providing a covert means of information exchange within images.

The primary goal is to use the idea of "Steganography," which is a subset of "Cryptography,â€œ to conceal a message within an image.
The process of hiding or encoding data so that only the intended recipient can read it is known as cryptography. To code messages, the art of cryptography has been employed. Another name for cryptology is the science of secure communications.
Encryption: The process of converting readable data (plaintext) into a coded format (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a cryptographic key.
Decryption: The reverse process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using the appropriate key.
Key Management: The secure handling of cryptographic keys, is vital for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of communication.
